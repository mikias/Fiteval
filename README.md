# Fiteval

## Fitness tracking app

A fitness focused, Medieval, role-playing game centered around training and improving your avatar and yourself. By tracking footsteps, GPS and heart rate, we reward players with experience and currency as they exercise and push themselves physically. As the heart rate increases, the rate of experience increases through movement. Players can walk across gold “caches” to get new items. Traveling to monuments or a similarly accessible location allows players to find “skill cards” that they can use to battle their friends.
